dev,3,20,97,1135,10,10,Monica,F,surprise,Not one that can pee on the roof.
dev,3,20,97,1135,11,11,Phoebe,F,joy,"Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
dev,3,20,97,1135,12,12,Chandler,M,surprise,And is this in case the house sneezes?
dev,3,20,97,1135,13,13,Phoebe,F,neutral,"No, no, thats the ghost for the attic."
